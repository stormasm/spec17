So everything is intact from
[spec-md](https://github.com/leebyron/spec-md)
and all I did was add a command to build my own personal blog / spec.

Initially out of the box when you run

```
npm install
```

the original spec17.md gets built...
Then if you want to modify or change your spec17.md simply run the command

```
npm run start
```

whose **start** tag is documented in package.json explaining exactly what it does.

Then you can push the changes in the out directory into the branch **gh-pages**.
